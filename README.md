# Homebrew search result pop-up
A userscript for popping up the Homebrew website ([brew.sh](https://brew.sh)) search results when arriving via a direct link.

There's [a search plugin for brew.sh](https://mycroftproject.com/install.html?id=112331&basename=formulae.brew.sh&icontype=ico&name=brew.sh) available on Mycroft Project that works just fine. But the site currently isn't really expecting visitors to arrive with a search term in hand and fails to open the actual search results which normally happens when the user clicks the Search button. Currently we only need to auto-click it with this script.

## Installation & usage
To use the script, you need
1. A userscript extension for your web browser, if you don't already have one
	- I recommend [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
2. To install the script, click on one of these:
	- [Install from GitHub](https://github.com/wtflm/homebrew-search-result-pop-up/raw/main/script.user.js)
	- [Install from Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/454124-homebrew-search-result-pop-up/code/Homebrew%20search%20result%20pop-up.user.js)
