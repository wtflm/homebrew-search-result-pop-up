# homebrew-search-result-pop-up
A userscript for popping up the Homebrew website ([brew.sh](https://brew.sh)) search results when arriving via a direct link.

There's [a search plugin for brew.sh](https://mycroftproject.com/install.html?id=112331&basename=formulae.brew.sh&icontype=ico&name=brew.sh) available on Mycroft Project that works just fine. But the site currently isn't really expecting visitors to arrive with a search term in hand and fails to open the actual search results which normally happens as a reaction to input in the site's search box. This script does just enough to mimic the user re-typing their search term to show the results.

## Installation & usage
To use the script, you need
- A userscript extension for your web browser
	- I recommend [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
- To install the script, click on one of these:
	- Install from GitHub
	- Install from Greasy Fork
